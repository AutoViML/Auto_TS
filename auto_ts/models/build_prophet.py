    # Prophet is a Little Complicated - You need 2 steps to Forecast
    ## 1. You need to create a dataframe to hold the predictions which specifies datetime
    ##    periods that you want to predict. It automatically creates one with both past
    ##    and future dates.
    ## 2. You need to ask Prophet to make predictions for the past and future dates in
    ##    that dataframe above.
    ## So if you had 2905 rows of data, and ask Prophet to predict for 365 periods,
    ##    it will give you predictions of the past (2905) and an additional 365 rows
    ##    of future (total: 3270) rows of data.
    ### This is where we take the first steps to make a forecast using Prophet:
    ##   1. Create a dataframe with datetime index of past and future dates
    print('Building Forecast dataframe. Forecast Period = %d' % forecast_period)
